What is Infectious Diseases?</b>
<br /> Infectious diseases encompass a range of illnesses caused by the invasion of harmful microorganisms or pathogens into the body. These pathogens include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, among others. <br /> Infectious diseases can vary widely in severity, from minor and self-limiting conditions such as the common cold and flu to more serious and potentially fatal illnesses like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and Ebola. <br />Treatment for infectious diseases may involve antibiotics or antiviral drugs, depending on the specific pathogen involved.  <br /> Additionally, preventive measures such as immunization and practicing good hygiene can help reduce the risk of contracting certain infectious diseases. </p>
