      From minor, self-limiting conditions like the common cold and flu, to more serious, possibly fatal conditions like HIV/AIDS, TB, and Ebola, infectious diseases can range in their severity. <br /> While certain infectious infections can be treated with antibiotics or antiviral drugs, others can be prevented by immunisation and taking necessary precautions. </p>
